## Course Description
**Official Calendar:** Databases from a user's perspective: querying with SQL, designing with UML, and using programs to analyze data. Construction of database-driven applications and websites and experience with current database technologies.  Completion of COSC 121 is recommended.
**Prerequisite:** One of COSC 111, COSC 123, COSC 210. Third-year standing.

**Specific description:** This course provides an introduction to database systems including database querying, design, and programming. The course consists of three major components. The first component explains databases from a user perspective including how to query using SQL and relational algebra. The second component involves designing relational databases using Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams and UML. The last component involves experiential learning on real-world use cases of databases for software development and data analytics. Technologies used include Java, JDBC, JSP, Python, Node.js, and PHP. Students completing the course have experience with current database technologies, and the ability to use databases, analyze the contained data, and develop programs to automate data analysis and presentation.

## Course Objectives
**Course Format:** Interactive classes consist of topic introduction, understanding evaluation using quick questions, and concept mastery with larger exercises.  Practical skills and applications of topics are covered in assignments as well as practice using industrial database systems and software.

**Learning Outcomes:**
 - Describe how databases provide data abstraction and simplify writing programs to store and manipulate data.
 - Create relational algebra queries on relational databases using selection, projection, join, and set operators.
 - Construct SQL CREATE TABLE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT statements including queries with multiple joins, aggregation, grouping, and subqueries. Explain the translation of a SQL query into relational algebra operators.
 - Analyze and understand existing database designs, design new databases using ER/UML modeling, and convert designs to the relational model including proper modeling of primary and foreign keys.
 - Develop programs and web sites that access a database to read data, perform analysis, and display output.
 - Perform data analysis, reporting, and visualization using data extracted from databases.
 - Use JSON and XML for data exchange and representation.
 - Execute and deploy databases on a computer using virtualization/containerization technology such as Docker.
 - Implement database security using user accounts/passwords and SQL privileges using GRANT and REVOKE.

## UBC Values
UBC creates an exceptional learning environment that fosters global citizenship, advances a civil and sustainable society, and supports outstanding research to serve the people of British Columbia, Canada, and the world. UBC’s core values are excellence, integrity, respect, academic freedom, and accountability.

## Policies and Regulations
Visit [UBC Okanagan’s Academic Calendar](https://okanagan.calendar.ubc.ca/campus-wide-policies-and-regulations) for a list of campus-wide regulations and policies, as well as [term dates and deadlines](https://okanagan.calendar.ubc.ca/dates-and-deadlines). 

## Missing an Exam
Only students who miss the final exam for a reason that corresponds to the University of British Columbia Okanagan's policy on excused absences from examinations will be permitted to take the final exam at a later time. A make-up exam may have a question format different from the regular exam. **There will be no make-up midterm exams.**  If the reason for absence is satisfactory, the student’s final exam will be worth more of the final grade.  Further information on Academic Concession is in the Academic Calendar http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/index.cfm?tree=3,48,0,0.

## Copyright Disclaimer   
Diagrams and figures included in lecture presentations adhere to Copyright Guidelines for UBC Faculty, Staff and Students http://copyright.ubc.ca/requirements/copyright-guidelines/ and UBC Fair Dealing Requirements for Faculty and Staff http://copyright.ubc.ca/requirements/fair-dealing/.  

## Grievances and Complaints Procedures
A student who has a complaint related to this course should follow the procedures summarized below:
 - The student should attempt to resolve the matter with the instructor first. Students may talk first to someone other than the instructor if they do not feel, for whatever reason, that they can directly approach the instructor. 
 - If the complaint is not resolved to the student's satisfaction, the student should e-mail the Associate Head, Dr. Warren Hare, warren.hare@ubc.ca. 
 
## Your Responsibilities
Your responsibilities to this class and to your education as a whole include attendance and participation. You have a responsibility to help create a classroom environment where all may learn. At the most basic level, this means you will respect the other members of the class and the instructor and treat them with the courtesy you hope to receive in return. Inappropriate classroom behavior may include: disruption of the classroom atmosphere, engaging in non-class activities, talking on a cell-phone, inappropriate use of profanity in classroom discussion, use of abusive or disrespectful language toward the instructor, a student in the class, or about other individuals or groups.

## Academic Integrity
The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work; nor should you help others to do the same. For example, it is prohibited to: share your past assignments and answers with other students; work with other students on an assignment when an instructor has not expressly given permission; or spread information through word of mouth, social media, websites, or other channels that subverts the fair evaluation of a class exercise, or assessment. Learn more through the [Academic Integrity website](https://academicintegrity.ubc.ca/student-start/).

## Academic Misconduct
Violations of academic integrity (i.e., academic misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred for consideration for academic discipline. Careful records are kept to monitor and prevent recurrences. Any instance of cheating or taking credit for someone else’s work, whether intentionally or unintentionally, can and often will result in at minimum a grade of zero for the assignment, and these cases will be reported to the Head of the Department and Associate Dean Academic of the Faculty.

**The use of artificial intelligence (AI) assistance, such as ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot, for any assessed portions of this course is not permitted unless explicitly specified by the instructor.**

## Academic Integrity Course Policies
Academic integrity is critical to being a professional developer and a respected person. This is a guide to what is and is not acceptable behaviors in this course.

### Grading Practices   
Faculties, departments, and schools reserve the right to scale grades in order to maintain equity among sections and conformity to University, faculty, department, or school norms. Students should therefore note that an unofficial grade given by an instructor might be changed by the faculty, department, or school. Grades are not official until they appear on a student's academic record. http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/index.cfm?tree=3,41,90,1014  If you have any questions about how academic integrity applies to this course, please consult with your professor.
