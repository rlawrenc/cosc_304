## Missing an Exam
Only students who miss the final exam for a reason that corresponds to the University of British Columbia Okanagan's policy on excused absences from examinations will be permitted to take the final exam at a later time. A make-up exam may have a question format different from the regular exam. There will be no make-up midterm exams.  If the reason for absence is satisfactory, the student’s final exam will be worth more of the final grade.  Further information on Academic Concession is in the Academic Calendar http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/index.cfm?tree=3,48,0,0.

## Grievances and Complaints Procedures
A student who has a complaint related to this course should follow the procedures summarized below:
 - The student should attempt to resolve the matter with the instructor first. Students may talk first to someone other than the instructor if they do not feel, for whatever reason, that they can directly approach the instructor. 
 - If the complaint is not resolved to the student's satisfaction, the student should go to the departmental chair John Braun at SCI 388, 807-8032 or e-mail him at john.braun@ubc.ca.  
 
## Your Responsibilities
Your responsibilities to this class and to your education as a whole include attendance and participation. You have a
responsibility to help create a classroom environment where all may learn. At the most basic level, this means you will
respect the other members of the class and the instructor and treat them with the courtesy you hope to receive in return.
Inappropriate classroom behavior may include: disruption of the classroom atmosphere, engaging in non-class activities,
talking on a cell-phone, inappropriate use of profanity in classroom discussion, use of abusive or disrespectful language
toward the instructor, a student in the class, or about other individuals or groups.

## Academic Integrity
The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity.  As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity.  At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required.  This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work.  Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed.  For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating usually result in a failing grade or mark of zero on the assignment or in the course.   Careful records are kept to monitor and prevent recidivism.  A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the policies and procedures, may be found: http://okanagan.students.ubc.ca/calendar/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0  If you have any questions about how academic integrity applies to this course, please consult with your professor.

Grades are not official until they appear on a student's academic record. http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/index.cfm?tree=3,41,90,1014  If you have any questions about how academic integrity applies to this course, please consult with your professor.
