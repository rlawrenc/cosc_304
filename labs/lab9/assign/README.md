# COSC 304 - Introduction to Database Systems<br>Lab 9 - Analysis and Development Assisted by AI

In this lab, you will add **one small but meaningful feature** to your analysis or development project. The feature should require **no more than about 2 hours** to implement and AI may help you complete it significantly faster. Examples include a new query/report, UI improvement, data validation, or Excel chart or visualization.

You must use **AI tools** (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini) to research or assist in implementing the feature, while ensuring you understand all submitted code and results.

## Deliverables

Submit your updated code (development stream) or Excel file (analysis stream) and three short paragraphs:

### **1. Feature Plan (3 marks)**
Describe the idea or feature you selected, why it fits your project, and the steps you planned to take to add it.

### **2. How AI Was Used (3 marks)**
Explain how you used AI: the questions you asked, how the AI responses helped or misled you, and what you modified or verified.

### **3. Reflection (3 marks)**
Reflect on your use of AI: what worked well, what didn’t, what you learned, and how you might use AI differently in the future. Did the AI save you time?

## Implementation (6 marks)
Your feature must:
- Work correctly  
- Provide a meaningful enhancement  
- Integrate cleanly with your existing project  
- Be implemented in an effective and appropriate way
- Explain your feature using a screenshot and a short summary
